# code-refactor
Refactoring and modifying the code to make it looks cleaner.

Added <header> tag for the html.

Changed the <div> tag to <nav> tag because the elements belonged to navigation bar.

Added unique selector (id) for search-engine-optimization in order for the link to work.

Added alternative text for images to make it accessible.

Added footer tag at the end to point to the footer of the page.
